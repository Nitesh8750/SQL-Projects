This repository contains SQL-based projects that demonstrate data analysis, querying, and manipulation of relational databases. These projects provide practical solutions to real-world data challenges using Structured Query Language (SQL).

# Projects
## 1. Pizza Sales Analysis
Description:
<br>
A comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data to gain insights into sales trends, top-performing pizzas, and customer preferences. The project utilizes SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data.
